# Civil-engineering-by-metals-in-a-New-particules-conductor---also-Chess-engine

letd start with log x and tzke a relationship with integrals of the differential formd and exp(x^2)+ integral(2x+3+exp(3)). this is another complicated formula tzken in my high school studied. the long terms means rhen that there is nonbetter way to keep track of the feal metals in a particle xonductor. then, lets begin woth ceramics again. after that a mix of ceramics and other metals. lets say plastics instead. the plastics suggest that we xan introduce sensors. then we can ise critical probes systems algorithms to produce z material.for.civil engineering. lets say materials which redpair themselves in order to see if hiychin morphism is suited for it. this is also heat transfer. then ceramics double layerd can be suited for the top of the buildings or homed.
